Elements
	C, H, O

 |
-C-  each hand be connected to -H (Can become -CH-, -CH2-, -CH3, or CH4), or -CH2-, -CH3
 |   at most one hand can be connected to -OH
     at most one hand can be connected to -COOH
     at most one hand can be connected to -CHO
     

 H
 |
-C=O The only one hand can be connected to -CH3, -CH2-
     or -COOH, or OH (same as HCOOH)

 O-H
 | 
-C=O The only one hand can be connected to -CHO, -CH2-, 
     H, or -CH3

-CH2- Can form a C chain. eg. CH3-CH2-CH2-COOH
      Each hand can be connected to -CH3, -CH2-, 
       |     |
      -CH-, -C-
      		 |
      At most one hand can be connected to -OH, -CHO, -COOH


 |
-CH-  See -CH2-

-CH=  double "bond" can only be connected to any other double bond
      eg, =CH-, =O

CH2=  same as -CH=

CH≡   triple bond can only be connected to any other triple bond
      eg. ≡C-, ≡CH
-C≡   S
